# VisualNewton
A physics engine for visualisation of Newtonian physics in the browser 

I am begining development of this project on 01/09/2020 as a exercise to gain experience in JavaScript for data visualisation. 

The goal of this is to create a library that can be used to create "worlds" in which objects have properties and interact under newtonian physics. 

I will create a webpage showing a physics sandbox to illustrate how the library works.
